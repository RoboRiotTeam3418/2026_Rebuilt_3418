### ⚠️ AI Analysis Failed

I ran into an issue connecting to Google Gemini. 

**Reason:** `{error_message}`

**What you should do:**
1. **Don't Panic.** This is likely an issue with the Google API limit, not your code.
2. You can try pushing another empty commit to trigger a retry.
3. Or, ask a human mentor to review your code manually.

*(This does NOT mean your code is perfect. I just couldn't check it.)*
